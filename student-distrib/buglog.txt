        description: when typing, there is no reaction on the screen 
        find takes: 20 min 
        fix takes: 15 min
        how to fix: we examine the value of master_mask, found that the value of master_mask and inb(data_port of master)
            are not the same, eventually we fixed it at the init_pic() that outb(master_mask) before enable_irq(2);

    BUG2
        description: RTC interrupt only be invoked one time.
        find takes: 20 min
        fix takes: 10 min
        how to fix: Referring to datasheet of RTC chip, IRQ pin of RTC should be cleared by reading register C when a RTC
                    interrupt is handled so that the next interrupt can be invoked.
