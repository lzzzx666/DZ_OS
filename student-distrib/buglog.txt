    BUG1
        description: read_data function could not get the correct size of the file. End position is 
                     always wrong with non-zero offset
        find takes: 10 min 
        fix takes: 5 min
        how to fix: offset/4096 and offset>>12 are not equivalent without casting 4096 to uint32_t. 
                    Using 4096u solves the problem.
